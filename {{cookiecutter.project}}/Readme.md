## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a valid Python installation on your system. This has been tested with Python 3.6. It does not assume a particulay version of python, however, it makes no assertions of proper working, either on this version of Python, or on another. 

## Installing

The folloiwing installations are for *nix-like systems. These have been tried on macOS Sierra (Version 10.12.6) before. 

1. Clone the program to your computer. 
2. type `make firstRun`. This should do the following
    2.1. generate a virtual environment in folder `env`
    2.2. install a number of packages
    2.3. generate a new `requirements.txt` file
    2.4. generate an initial git repository
3. change to the `src` folder
4. run the command `make run`. This should run the small test program
5. Generate your documentation folder by running `make docInit`. Follow instructions to prepare the system for autodoc installation that cannot be done automatically.
6. run the command `make doc` to build the documentation.
7. Check whether all the tests pass with the command `make test`. This uses py.test for running tests.
